# tech-hot-takes

Honestly? This ain't really my cup of coffee. I’m not the type to write blogs — but I need something to keep myself sane at this point.

Before we begin, I’d like to humbly apologize for not giving a single fuck — *respectively*. This won’t be your typical “how to use React” kind of shitfuckery. We’ve had enough of those “2 girls 1 cup” tutorial remakes. The original remains a lesson... for those brave enough.

## structure? yeah, about that...

It’s a simple repo. You'll find subfolders, categorized by whatever theme I feel like writing about. Not super educational, but hopefully entertaining.

And yeah — don’t take it too seriously. I’m just some guy with minimal computer knowledge (a fucking ape might have more than me).

## what you’ll find here

- unfiltered thoughts  
- some takes you’ll agree with  
- some you’ll hate  
- and probably some that’ll make you go “bro, wtf”

---

## last thing

You don’t have to agree with any of it. If someday you wanna fork this and add your own rants — go for it.

Tech isn’t about being right all the time. It’s about being curious, confused, and a little broken... but still showing up.

Anyway, enough rambling. Click on a folder. Pick a post. See where it takes you.
